### Template Method

#### Intent
"Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets
subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure." (GoF)

#### Additional Notes
- It is similar to the strategy pattern. The only difference is, that the template method provides a skeleton of the
algorithm
- The pattern is highly related to the Open Closed Principle, which states that classes should be open for extension,
put closed for modification.
